|--------|----------|-----------------|-------------|-------|

**Decision Tree:**

**If 4-5 metrics PASS:**
- ✅ **SYSTEM WORKS!**
- Continue trading
- Consider adding capital for faster growth
- Set withdrawal schedule

**If 2-3 metrics PASS:**
- ⚠️ **SYSTEM WORKS BUT NEEDS ADJUSTMENT**
- Reduce position size if avg loss too high
- Check if spread is killing profits
- Consider switching to ECN broker
- Continue for another 50 trades

**If 0-1 metrics PASS:**
- ❌ **SYSTEM NOT WORKING**
- Stop trading immediately
- Full investigation:
  - Is broker spread too wide?
  - Is config wrong?
  - Is market regime different?
  - Is D1 gate too restrictive?
- Options:
  1. Switch to ECN broker
  2. Use wider SL (0.5/1.5 instead of 0.1/2.0)
  3. Adjust D1 gate
  4. Stop trading this system

## IF SYSTEM FAILS AFTER 50 TRADES

**My commitment: I won't let you blow the account.**

**If after 50 trades you're losing >$50:**

### Step 1: STOP TRADING
- Pause bot immediately
- Don't risk more until we know why

### Step 2: FORENSIC INVESTIGATION
- Analyze every trade
- Check actual spread vs expected
- Verify execution quality
- Review D1 gate logic
- Check if config is correct
- Compare to backtest expectations

### Step 3: IDENTIFY ROOT CAUSE

**Possible causes:**
1. **Broker spread too wide**
   - Solution: Switch to ECN broker
2. **Execution issues**
   - Solution: Test different broker
3. **Market regime changed**
   - Solution: Adjust D1 gate or wait
4. **Config error**
   - Solution: Fix config, restart
5. **System doesn't work live**
   - Solution: Stop, use different strategy

### Step 4: RECOMMENDATION

**I will give you ONE of these:**

**A. Switch to ECN Broker**
- Open IC Markets or Pepperstone
- Deposit $200
- Restart with tighter spreads
- Expected: System will work

**B. Use Wider SL/TP**
- Change to 0.5 ATR SL / 1.5 ATR TP
- Accept lower profit (but more stable)
- Expected: $5/day instead of $10

**C. Adjust D1 Gate**
- Weaken the gate (more trades)
- Or remove it (test without)
- Risk: More drawdown

**D. Stop This System**
- System doesn't work live
- Backtest was unrealistic
- Try different approach

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**After 50-100 trades, you're successful if:**

✅ Win rate: 12-20%  
✅ Avg loss: <$1.50  
✅ Expectancy: >$0.50  
✅ Total P&L: >$0 (at least break-even)  
✅ Account: >$150 (not losing capital)  

**If these are met:** You have a working system! Keep going! 🚀

---

## COMPOUNDING PLAN (IF SUCCESSFUL)

**Month 1-2: Prove it works**
- Keep position at 0.015-0.020 lots
- Don't withdraw anything
- Target: $200-250 account by end of month 2

**Month 3: Start withdrawals**
- Increase position to 0.025 lots
- Withdraw 50% of profits weekly
- Keep 50% to compound

**Month 6: Scale up**

**Month 12: Full capacity**

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**This is a 2-4 week experiment.**

**After 50-100 trades, we will KNOW:**
- ✅ Does it work?
- ✅ Can you earn $10/day?
- ✅ Should you continue?

**I will guide you through every step.**

**If it doesn't work, I'll tell you honestly and help you find alternatives.**
