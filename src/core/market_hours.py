"""Broker-reality guards -- REAL_MONEY_READINESS.md IV.6.

Three things the live loop never handled, each of which has a real cost:

  * WEEKEND GAP. Gold gaps on the Sunday open. A position held over the weekend
    can gap straight through its stop -- the stop is a trigger price, not a
    guarantee, and the fill happens wherever the market reopens. The document's
    decision: flatten Friday ~21:00 IST, hold nothing over the weekend.
  * ROLLOVER. Spreads balloon around 00:00 server time. The FVG leg's ~$5.50
    stop is small enough that a rollover spread spike alone can take it out,
    so entries are skipped in a window around it.
  * MAINTENANCE / MARKET CLOSED. Exness has a short daily maintenance window.
    Without detection the loop retry-spams and fills the log with noise that
    hides real failures.

Times are IST (the project's convention) except the rollover window, which is
anchored to broker server time (UTC on Exness) because that is what the spread
actually keys off.
