"""Record-and-check layer on top of SystemConfig.

Every time a backtest run produces a result someone is willing to trust,
record() it here with its exact SystemConfig fingerprint. main_loop.py checks
its live fingerprint against this ledger on startup (see check_live_config())
and refuses to trade on a configuration nobody has actually validated --
instead of silently running whatever the code currently happens to do, which
is how portfolio_v4 ended up live with an unvalidated exposure-cap change and
the D1 gate in a different state than any backtest tested.

This does not judge whether a result is "good" -- a losing backtest can be
recorded too (see HYP-047's pre-fix entry). It only answers "has THIS EXACT
configuration been run through a backtest and had its result written down,"
so a human always knows whether live matches something measured.
