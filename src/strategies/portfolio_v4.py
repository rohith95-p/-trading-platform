"""Portfolio v4 -- history and current state.

ORIGINAL (2026-09-01): four session-specialist legs (squeeze_break ASIA,
ema_stack LONDON, fvg NY, range_rejection NY). Declared dead 2026-09-03
(SYSTEM_FAULTS.md): selected by screening 90+ candidates and kept because they
scored best on their own selection window; a 4-year holdout gave PF 0.965
(loses money). A real bug in EMASTACK's dedup was later found and fixed
(HYP-046/047), recovering a genuine but thin edge in FVG specifically -- see
the ledger for the full history. All four original classes remain below,
unused by PORTFOLIO_V4, for reference and possible reuse.

CURRENT (2026-09-07, HYP-059/060): PORTFOLIO_V4 runs two NY-session FVG legs --
FVGNYSweepOrVoid (liquidity-filtered: a preceding sweep, or a gap exceeding
0.5x ATR200) and FVGNYTight (unfiltered, which under the engine's Highlander
one-FVG-per-candle rule trades only the gaps SweepOrVoid rejects). Same
underlying XAU-092 fair-value-gap detector throughout.

FVGNYSweep and FVGNYVoid were REMOVED from the list 2026-09-08: each is a
strict subset of FVGNYSweepOrVoid and always loses the Highlander ranking to
it (rank 5 > 4 > 3), so both took exactly zero trades in every backtest window
(1-month, 3-month, 1-year). Classes kept below for reference only. Dropping
them does not change any result -- the 4-leg and 2-leg runs are identical.

Combined backtest, live config, 2025-01-01 -> 2026-05-20 holdout: see
docs/research/RESEARCH_LEDGER.md HYP-061 for the exact numbers.

Each class carries its own sl_atr_mult / tp_atr_mult, read by main_loop.py
and passed through to RiskManager.calculate_atr_stops() via the new
tp_multiplier parameter -- these do NOT match the live system's hardcoded
session multipliers (1.5 London/NY, 2.0 Asia), which is exactly why a
per-strategy override was needed rather than relying on session auto-detect.

                          forced flow (stops run), not drift.
      "void"           -- only gaps exceeding `void_mult` x ATR200, the
                          script's own literal "liquidity void" definition --
