"""Transaction cost and fill modelling.

Prior backtests in this project applied no spread, no slippage and no
commission. On XAUUSDm the measured spread runs ~260 points ($0.26) against a
typical 1.5xATR stop of ~$16, so a round trip consumes roughly 1.6% of risk --
and against the live trailing stop, which banks about +0.4xATR ($4.2), it eats
closer to 6% of the average winner. That is not a rounding error.

MT5 bars carry a per-bar `spread` field in points, so historical spread is
observed rather than assumed. Slippage is not observable from bars and is
modelled explicitly with a stated assumption.

    """Converts mid/bar prices into executable bid and ask.

    Attributes:
        spread_source: "bar" uses each bar's recorded spread field; "fixed" uses
            `fixed_spread_points` throughout. "bar" is the default because it is
            the only one grounded in observation.
        fixed_spread_points: Spread used when `spread_source == "fixed"`, and the
            fallback when a bar reports a nonsensical zero spread.
        spread_multiplier: Stress-test knob. 1.0 is the observed market; 2.0 asks
            what happens if every spread doubles.
        slippage_points: Adverse price movement applied to every market order and
            every stop-out, in points. Stop orders slip; limit orders do not.
        commission_per_lot_roundtrip: Account currency charged per 1.0 lot for a
            full round trip. Exness Standard is spread-only, so this defaults to
            zero, but it is here so a commission account can be modelled.
        swap_long_points / swap_short_points: Overnight financing in points per
            1.0 lot per night, signed as the broker reports it (negative = the
            account pays). Verified live on XAUUSDm 2026-09-01: long -515.5,
            short 0.0, swap_mode 1. That asymmetry is real money -- at 0.01 lot a
            long pays ~$0.52 a night while a short pays nothing -- and no prior
            backtest in this repo modelled it at all.
        enable_swap: Off switch, so the size of the swap assumption can itself be
            measured by running the same config with and without it.
        rollover_hour_utc: Server rollover instant. The Exness server runs
            UTC+0.00 (verified), so nights are counted across 00:00 UTC.
        triple_swap_weekday: Weekday (Mon=0) on which brokers book three nights
            to cover the weekend. None disables it; it is off by default because
            it was not verified on this account.
